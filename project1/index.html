        <b>HTML</b> stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b>, which is the most widely used language on Web to
        develop
        web pages. <b>HTML</b> was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML
        specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late
        1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension
        to
        HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.
